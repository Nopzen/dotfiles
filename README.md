# Nopzen's development environment

How I setup new machines for Work or Private laptops. This guide helps me install my daily driver tools to get my up and running. Feel free to re-use this configuration, and fit to your own needs.

See the Table of Content to get a grasp of what this repository is trying to do, each section is trying to describe with broad terms of whats needs to be done,
if a more detailed guide have been written by me, I will try and link a guide to this.

### 2. Editor
As a daily driver of 2021, I'm using VSCode due to is versatility, and amazing extensions. 

I primarily work full stack within a JavaScript/TypeScript, so from that standpoint VSCode is a really nice tool as it comes with natively support for TypeScript, which I use a lot :)

I run VSCode on my _local_ machine.
